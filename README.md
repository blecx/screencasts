The intention is to write a network hook for a nat used in the libvirt environment. This is used to for kbm/qemu guest that are behind a nat network and could not be reached from outside. network hooks can be used to overcome this.

In this repo, it is only show how to make hook work, not how to overcome the base kvm/qemu guest problem. 

Adescription of the problem itself is described by [Muhammad Kamran Azeem](https://cooker.wbitt.com/index.php/XEN,_KVM,_Libvirt_and_IPTables) in his article. He also explains this in a [youtube video servies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCo3KOCu8o). Both the article and the video are pretty old, but still valid, because nothing has change since.

## The  [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qazma4WMFEM&t=182) show how to practice this example.
